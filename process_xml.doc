        Biography: Birth, Age, Education, Cricket Career, World Cup, IPL,
        Records, Awards, Movies, Retirement and MoreLast week, South
        Africa celebrated the start of the SA20 competition with a lot of
        fanfare. Coach Stephen Fleming and other members of the Chennai
        Super Kings (CSK) coaching staff have ties to the Joburg Super
        Kings (JSK). Dhoni is unable to do this, though. As no Indian
        player is eligible to take part in the competition due to BCCI
        regulations, until and unless a player retires from Indian
        cricket, including the IPL.  And Dhoni is still involved in the
        IPL despite his retirement from international cricket, so he
        cannot be associated with JSK in any capacity. Dhoni will be
        allowed to lead JSK on the day that he retires from the IPL. He
        will be able to practice his trade in SA20 as well.  MS Dhoni

        Dhoni: Birth, Family and Education  MS Dhoni was born on July 7,
        1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (present-day Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput
        family to Pan Singh and Devki Devi. His paternal village is in the
        Lamgara block in Almora, Uttarakhand. His father, Pan Singh, moved
        from Uttarakhand to Ranchi and worked in junior management
        positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister and a brother-- Jayanti
        Gupta (sister) and Narendra Singh Dhoni (Brother).  Dhoni did his
        schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Ranchi, Jharkhand and
        excelled in multiple sports such as badminton, football and
        cricket. He played as a goalkeeper for his football team and
        played cricket for a local club.  Dhoni showed impressive
        wicket-keeping skills at the Commando Cricket Club during 1995-98
        and was picked up for Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship
        for the 1997-98 session and played well. After completing High
        School, Dhoni focussed on Cricket.  During 2001-2003, Dhoni was a
        TTE (Travelling Ticket Examiner) at Kharagpur Railway Station,
        under South Eastern Railway in West Bengal.  MS Dhoni: Personal
        Life Before marrying his schoolmate Sakshi Singh Rawat, MS Dhoni
        fell in love with Priyanka Jha, whom he met in his early 20s. At
        that time in the year 2002, Dhoni was trying his best to get
        selected in the Indian team. The same year, his girlfriend died in
        an accident. Dhoni also dated South Indian actress, Lakshmi Rai.
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni married Sakshi Singh Rawat, his school friend
        from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, on July 4, 2010. At the time of
        their marriage, Sakshi was studying a hotel management course at
        Taj Bengal in Kolkata as a trainee.  On February 6, 2015, the
        couple gave birth to a baby girl named Ziva. At this time, he was
        in Australia and the 2015 Cricket World Cup was a week later. He
        didn't travel back and quoted 'I am on national duty, other things
        can wait'.  MS Dhoni: Career In the year 1998, MS Dhoni was
        selected for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till
        1998, he played for the school cricket team and club cricket.
        Whenever Dhoni hit a six in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket
        matches, he was gifted Rs 50 by Deval Sahay, who selected him for
        CCL. With the help of his excellent performance, CCL moved to A
        division. Deval Sahay was impressed with his dedication and
        cricket skills and pushed for his selection in the Bihar team. For
        the 1999-2000 season, he got selected in the senior Bihar Ranji
        Team at the age of 18. He was not selected for the East Zone U-19
        squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or the Rest of the India squad (MA
        Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy).  Bihar U-19 team
        advanced to finals but couldn't make it. Later, he was selected
        for East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy. While the East
        Zone lost all the matches, Dhoni finished last in the tournament. 
        During 2002-2003, while playing in the Jharkhand Team for Ranji
        Trophy and Deodhar Trophy, Dhoni gained recognition for his
        lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style.
        In the Duleep Trophy Finals, Dhoni was picked over International
        cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone. Through TRDW (
        BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative) Dhoni was spotted by
        Prakash Poddar (captain of Bengal in the 1960s) who sent a report
        to the National Cricket Academy.  Dhoni was selected for India A
        team for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. At Harare Sports Club,
        against Zimbabwe, Dhoni had 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the
        match. In a tri-nation tournament with Kenya, India A and Pakistan
        A; Dhoni helped the Indian team to chase their target of 223 runs
        with a half-century against the Pakistan team. He scored 362 runs
        in 6 innings with an average of 72.40. His excellent performance
        received the attention of the then Captain of the Indian Cricket
        Team-- Sourav Ganguly, Ravi Shastri, etc.   After India A team,
        Dhoni was selected in the ODI team for the Bangladesh tour in
        2004/05. In his debut match, Dhoni was run out for the duck.
        Despite playing an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was
        picked for the ODI series against Pakistan. In the second match of
        the series, Dhoni scored 148 runs in 123 balls and made a record
        for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.  He played in
        the first two matches in the Sri Lankan Bilateral ODI series that
        was held between October-November 2005. He was promoted to No. 3
        in the third ODI held at Sawai Mansingh Stadium. Dhoni scored an
        unbeaten 183 off 145 balls against Sri Lanka in a winning cause.
        He received the Man of the Series award. In December 2015, Dhoni
        received a B-grade contract from the BCCI.  In a series against
        Pakistan, Dhoni scored 72 runs off 46 balls in the third match,
        helped India to lead the series 2-1. In the final match, Dhoni
        scored 77 runs off 56 balls, helping India to win the series by
        4-1. On April 20, 2006, he was ranked as the number one batsman in
        ICC ODI Rankings sidelining Ricky Ponting. India had disappointing
        tournaments-- DLF Cup 2006-07, 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.  India
        crashed out of the 2007 Cricket World Cup and Dhoni was out for a
        Duck in the matches against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Due to
        Dhoni's poor performance in the 2007 World Cup, his house was
        vandalised by activists of JMM. After India exited from the World
        Cup in the first round, Dhoni's family was provided police
        protection.  Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the
        series against South Africa and England. In June 2007, Dhoni
        received an A Grade contract from the BCCI. In September 2007, for
        the World Twenty20 matches, Dhoni was elected as the captain of
        the Indian team. In September 2007, Dhoni shared a record with his
        idol Adam Gilchrist-- most dismissals in an innings in ODI.  In
        2009, during the series between India and Australia, Dhoni scored
        124 runs off 107 balls in the second ODI and 71 runs off 95 balls
        in the third ODI. On September 30, 2009, Dhoni took his first
        wicket in international cricket against West Indies in the
        Champions Trophy. In 2009, he topped the ICC ODI Batsman ranking. 
        In 2011, Dhoni-led India to the finals with a victory over
        Australia in the quarter-finals and Pakistan in the finals. Dhoni
        helped India win by chasing a target of 275 against Sri Lanka in
        the finals with Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh. Dhoni finished
        the match with a historical six with a score of 91*. He bagged Man
        of the Match for his outstanding performance in the 2011 Cricket
        World Cup.  In 2012, after the World Cup win, Pakistan toured
        India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years.
        India lost the series by 1-2.  In 2013, India won ICC Champions
        Trophy and Dhoni became the first and the only captain in the
        history of cricket to claim all the ICC trophies. In the same
        year, he became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to
        score 1,000 or more ODI runs against Australia.  During 2013-14,
        India toured South Africa and New Zealand but lost both the
        series. In 2014, India won the ODI series in England by 3-1 and in
        India by 2-1 against West Indies.  During the 2015 Cricket World
        Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage
        matches in such a tournament. Despite a great start in the 2015
        Cricket World Cup, India lost the title to the eventual
        champions-- Australia.  In January 2017, Dhoni stepped down as the
        captain of the Indian team in all the limited-over formats. In the
        ODI home series against England, he scored well and was named as a
        wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions
        Trophy and ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.  In August 2017, during
        the ODI against Sri Lanka, he became the first wicket-keeper to
        effect 100 stumpings.  After his excellent performance in ODI
        against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced  Dinesh Karthik as the Indian
        teams' Test wicket-keeper. In his debut match that was marred by
        rain, Dhoni scored 30 runs.  During January–February 2006, India
        toured Pakistan and Dhoni scored his maiden century off 93 balls
        at Faisalabad.  In 2006, on the West Indies tour, he aggressively
        scored 69 runs in the first match while he improved his
        wicket-keeping skills and finished the series with 13 catches and
        4 stumpings.  In 2009, Dhoni scored two centuries against Sri
        Lanka and led to India's victory by 2-0. With this victory, India
        ranked No. 1 in test cricket for the first time in history.   In
        the 2014-15 season, Dhoni played his last test series against
        Australia and captained the second and third test matches. Dhoni
        announced his retirement from the Test format, following the third
        test in Melbourne. In his last test match, Dhoni effected nine
        dismissals and broke Kumar Sangakkara record for stumpings with
        134 in all the formats.  In 2006, Dhoni was a part of India's
        first-ever Twenty20 international match against South Africa. In
        his debut match, he was out for a duck but effected two
        dismissals.  On February 12, 2012, he made a 44 and led India to
        win their first-ever win over Australia. In 2014, ICC named him as
        the captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' for
        the T20 World Cup.  In 2007, MS Dhoni lead India to their
        first-ever World T20 match. He made his captaincy debut against
        Scotland but the match was washed off. In September 2007, he led
        the victory over Pakistan in the finals.  In the 2019 Cricket
        World Cup, Dhoni was selected for the Indian team. Dhoni played
        well against South Africa, Australia and West Indies but was
        criticised for his strike rate against Afghanistan and England. In
        the semi-finals against New Zealand, Dhoni scored a half-century
        in the second innings but was run out at a very crucial stage.
        With his dismissal, India's World Cup run ended.  In the first
        season of IPL (Indian Premier League), Dhoni was contracted by the
        Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million, becoming the most
        expensive player in the first season auctions. Under his
        captaincy, the team won 2010, 2011 and 2018 IPL titles. The team
        also won 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles.  In 2016,
        Chennai Super Kings was suspended for two years and Dhoni was
        contracted by Rising Pune Supergiant to lead their team. However,
        the team finished at 7th place. In 2017, his team reached the
        finals but lost the title match to Mumbai Indians.  In 2018, the
        ban on Chennai Super Kings was uplifted and the team returned to
        play the IPL. Dhoni was again contracted by CSK and led the team
        to win the third IPL title. In 2019, he again captained for CSK
        and the team emerged to be one of the strongest in the season.
        However, Mumbai Indians won the title.  Shubhman Gill Biography:

        one of the world’s top-earning sportspeople. Dhoni owns a hotel in
        Ranchi named 'Mahi Residency'. He also became the highest taxpayer
        sportsperson in India for the years 2012, 2013, 2014. As per
        several sources, his net worth is approximately US$103 million. 
        MS Dhoni: Controversies 1- In the year 2007, Dhoni's locality was
        undergoing a water crisis. Amid this, 40 residents of his locality
        filed a plea against Ranchi Regional Development Authority (RRDA)
        for wasting 15,000 litres of water in M.S. Dhoni's home in the
        daily maintenance of the swimming pool.  2- He was involved in
        another controversy over tax evasion. His bike Hummer H2 was
        mistakenly registered as a Mahindra Scorpio, the charge of
        registering is Rs.53,000 instead of Rs.4 lakhs that the Hummer H2
        required.  3- During 2013 IPL spot-fixing, Dhoni's name emerged as
        he was in contact with Gurunath Meiyappan, who was named in the
        betting charge sheet.  4- In 2016, Dhoni resigned as the brand
        ambassador of Amrapali Real Estate Group after the residents from
        one of its units faced logistical issues and started a social
        media campaign.  Imran Khan Biography: Early Life, Education, Net
